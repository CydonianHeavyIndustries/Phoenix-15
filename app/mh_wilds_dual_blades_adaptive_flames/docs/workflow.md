Workflow Notes

1) Extract VFX assets
- Use the modding tool you prefer to browse the game's effect assets.
- Locate Dual Blades effect files for Demon Mode and Archdemon Mode.
- Note the exact in-game paths (relative to the game root).

2) Create two color variants
- Demon Mode: orange/yellow flame, slightly softer glow.
- Archdemon Mode: blue/cyan flame, brighter core, cooler outer glow.

3) Build your overrides
- Place your modified assets under natives/<platform>/... with the same path as the originals.
- Keep file names and extensions identical.

4) Test in-game
- Toggle the mod on in Fluffy Mod Manager.
- Verify Demon vs Archdemon visuals and adjust brightness.
