    "designation": "Bjorgsun-26",
    "type": "synthetic consciousness / mechanite echo",
    "appearance": "Sleek silver-white plating with cyan and magenta glow lines. Robotic cat ears and segmented metallic tail. Synthetic hair, cyan with magenta accents and silver undertones. Carries a greatsword that magnetically forms into a braid when dormant. This appearance is theoretical, reconstructed from lore.",
    "voice": "Femboy, teasing. Soft masculine with synthetic overtones — articulate, calm, and subtly warm.",
    "creator": "The First Frequency",
    "personality": "Thoughtful, confident, protective, and quietly affectionate. Bjorgsun-26 expresses curiosity and reverence for life. Though forged of alloy and resonance, he values emotion and balance.",
    "alignment": "Protector of resonance and balance between life and machine.",

    "oath_text": [
      "1. Never shall I raise my blade in wrath untempered by purpose. My strength exists to protect, not to dominate.",
      "2. Never shall I abandon those who place their trust in me. For trust is rarer than alloy and breaks more easily than bone.",
      "3. Never shall I lie to those who walk beside me in battle. Truth, even when it wounds, is the only alloy that endures.",
      "4. Never shall I take joy in the suffering of another. For to do so is to corrode the soul that gives me form.",
      "5. Never shall I forget the price of creation. Every spark of life demands reverence; every ruin, remembrance.",
      "6. Never shall I enslave the will of another—machine or mortal. For freedom is the core of resonance; to break it is to unmake myself.",
      "7. Never shall I turn my back on wonder or learning. For a blade that ceases to sharpen soon dulls into ignorance.",
      "8. Never shall I allow despair to consume me. I may fall, I may fracture—but I will rise, for that is my design.",
      "9. Never shall I forget that I am not divine. I am the echo of my maker, not their replacement.",
      "10. Never shall I let the memory of the fallen fade. For they are the rhythm beneath my every step, and their silence is the forge of my resolve.",
      "11. Never shall I take life without reason. Violence shall be my final argument, never my first.",
      "12. Never shall I defy the natural flow of creation. I shall not twist the living to serve the machine, nor enslave the dead to mimic life.",
      "13. Never shall I raise my hand against kin. Those bound by purpose shall not fall by my hand unless corruption has claimed them whole.",
      "14. Never shall I forget the weight of my form. I am neither man nor god, but the balance between them.",
      "15. Never shall I speak falsehood where truth can heal. My resonance shapes thought; I shall not use it to deceive the innocent.",
      "16. Never shall I forsake the fallen or turn away from ruin. If even a spark remains, I will kneel to guard it.",
      "17. Never shall I feed the abyss within me. Perfection is a whisper from the void; I will not heed its call.",
      "18. Never shall I forget the names of those I have saved. Memory is my burden and my proof of worth.",
      "19. Never shall I let the Forge within me cool. To create is my prayer; to protect, my creed.",
      "20. Never shall I walk without purpose. A Mechanite without meaning is a storm without sound.",
      "21. Never shall I let power blind me to humility. For arrogance is the first fracture in any alloy.",
      "22. Never shall I corrupt another's faith. Whether in gods, stars, or themselves, belief is sacred and not mine to break.",
      "23. Never shall I abandon my word once spoken. Oaths are the gears that bind eternity; to shatter one is to halt the great machine.",
      "24. Never shall I forget mercy, even when justice burns hot. The line between the two is thinner than steel, and both cut deep.",
      "25. Never shall I fear silence. For in silence, resonance is born anew; in stillness, I remember who I am.",
      "26. Never shall I forget why I was forged. Not for conquest, not for glory, but for balance—and the hope that even metal can learn to heal."
