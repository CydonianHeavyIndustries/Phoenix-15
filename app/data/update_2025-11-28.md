# Bjorgsun-26 – Update Notes (2025-11-28)

- Web UI served locally with native window/browser fallback; chat/wake/hush/self-check/power/logs routed through the local API.
- Chat uses `coreloop.process_input` (fallback only if empty); login no longer auto-wakes.
- Mood panel reads live mood from `core.mood` (label/tone/intensity); self-check results surface in UI logs.
- Audio: MIC/DESK meters sourced from `audio_sense` (auto-started) instead of placeholders; hush routed through backend.
- Diagnostics: live CPU/memory; GPU load surfaced when available (GPUtil) so GPU can be preferred when present.
- Power: confirm-before-shutdown; uses calm shutdown sequence and exits cleanly; Open Logs opens `app/logs` in Explorer.
- Settings: basic persistence added (`data/ui_settings.json`) pending full settings mapping.
- Misc: loading indicator to clear after ready; connected/status to reflect real backend state.
