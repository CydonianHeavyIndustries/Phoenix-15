KAELITHAR A Glimpse Into the Fractured World Kaelithar is not a land — it is a world broken across sky and stone. Once, it sang with the harmony of magic and machines. Great rivers of energy called leylines carved glowing paths through the air and across the land. Entire civilizations rose around them, taming storms, bending steel with a whisper, and soaring among the clouds. But something happened. Now, the leylines fracture. The sky swirls with riftstorms. Islands float where mountains once stood. Forgotten ruins whisper of wonders and warnings — of a golden age swallowed by time. You are born into this new era: a survivor, an explorer, a spark among the ashes. Magic still exists, but it is unpredictable. Some say it is alive. Others say it is dying. Technology from the old world can be found, but it is dangerous to awaken. Some machines remember what came before. Some do not forgive. There are cities in the clouds, wastelands beneath thunder, creatures that don’t belong in this world… and whispers of something watching from beyond the rifts. You are not chosen. You are not destined. You are here. And what you do next will echo across Kaelithar.
