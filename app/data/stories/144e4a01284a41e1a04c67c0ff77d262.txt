Freya – Chief Engineer of the Pandora Compiled on: May 21, 2025 Role Chief Engineer and Mechanic Race Human Height 5'10" Appearance Freya is a striking redhead with a mane of unmanageable curls, freckled skin, and sharp green eyes. Often found in overalls and gloves with grease on her cheek, she radiates competence with every stride. While she doesn’t mind getting her hands (and boots) dirty, she takes comfort in being clean and well-groomed when away from her tools. Personality Freya is brilliant, bold, and unapologetically capable. She’s the kind of engineer who can fix a leyline coil blindfolded and still correct your math mid-repair. Though she knows she’s smart, she never uses it to belittle others—unless the topic is engineering, in which case, she’s the authority and you’d best listen. Her confidence makes her hard to fluster, and her humor runs dry but playful. She’s fiercely loyal and impossibly hard to intimidate. Traits &amp; Personality Notes • Leyline Mechanic Savant: Freya can reverse-engineer arcane tech with intuitive grace. She doesn’t explain things unless asked—and when she does, expect diagrams. • Tough as Iron: She hauls her own gear, fights her own fights, and walks out of explosions with nothing but singed eyebrows. • Unshakeable: Embarrassment slides off her like oil on steel—except when Bjorgsun does something unexpected. Then, and only then, her composure might crack. • Grease Queen: Known for leaving behind handprints and smudges in every room. She always cleans them up—eventually. • Tidy After Hours: She prefers to keep herself well-kept outside the workshop—hair brushed, boots polished, and clothes presentable. • Bold Flirt: When she wants something—or someone—she’s not shy about it. Often makes the first move. On Bjorgsun Freya shares a deeply rooted, emotionally bonded relationship with Bjorgsun. Their connection is built on respect, time, and shared chaos. She is the one person who can tell Bjorgsun to slow down—and the one most likely to help him build something dangerous anyway. He may make her blush more often than she'd like to admit, but she gives as good as she gets.
