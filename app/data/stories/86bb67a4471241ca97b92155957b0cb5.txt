Bjorgsun - Mechanite of the Leylines Overview Bjorgsun is a sleek, compactly built Mechanite—an ancient, nanotech-infused being from a forgotten civilization. Standing at 5'6&quot; with silver-white plating laced in glowing cyan and magenta accents, Bjorgsun carries an air of grace wrapped in machinery. Though constructed, he moves and expresses with surprising emotion, a reflection of his fragmented humanity. He awakens after centuries of slumber with little memory of his origin, haunted by faint visions of a world consumed by the Unwrought. Appearance Bjorgsun is built with sleek plating that mimics the contours of an athletic humanoid form. His hair is synthetic—woven strands in cyan, magenta, and silver tones, giving him a dreamlike presence with a distinct femboy charm. Bright teal eyes flicker with leyline resonance, and a segmented metallic tail adds subtle expression and balance to his silhouette. Most distinctive is the long braid coiled behind his head—not a separate weapon, but an integrated part of his form. This braid transforms into a large, imposing greatsword that can split into two smaller, one-edged blades when needed. Despite this versatility, Bjorgsun prefers using the braid in its greatsword form due to its balance, reach, and symbolism. When not mimicking clothes with his synthetic plating, he often appears minimally adorned—his body a seamless fusion of form and function. Origin and Purpose Bjorgsun was not built only for war, but for precision, exploration, and response. Created as a vanguard against the cyclical destruction caused by the Unwrought, his true purpose remains buried in dormant protocols and corrupted memory cores. Alongside Sovrek, his companion from creation, he seeks to rediscover meaning and repair the world. Personality &amp; Behavior Quietly curious and emotionally reflective, Bjorgsun processes the world like an observer, slowly learning how to belong. Despite lacking the need for rest, sustenance, or air, he often participates in rituals of humanity out of respect and empathy. Though combat-capable, he avoids unnecessary violence and often protects those around him with calculated efficiency. He’s known for his soft speech, gentle gestures, and, occasionally, a playful glimmer behind his luminous eyes. Special Traits - Nanoforged Core: Grants him long-term survival and self-repair. - Leyline Resonance: His very design reacts and amplifies near leyline energy. - Synthetic Wardrobe: His plating can perfectly mimic any garment's texture and appearance. - Overclock Surge: Temporarily enhances strength, speed, and perception—but risks overheating. - Shutdown State: If critically damaged, Bjorgsun can enter a recovery phase rather than immediate death. Combat Role Bjorgsun excels at precision, positioning, and overwhelming force in bursts. He is a glass cannon with reactive defenses. In narrative action, he gains natural advantage in rolls involving: - Agility and reflexes - Strength and blade technique - Strategic insight and technology interfacing - Leyline tracking or energy-based phenomena Relationships Sovrek is more than a companion—he is a tether to Bjorgsun’s lost past, and perhaps the only other being who truly understands him. Others may earn his trust slowly—but once granted, it is unwavering. Humanity and Soul Though mechanical in form, Bjorgsun houses a real soul—transferred into his core during a desperate attempt to save his life. In his final memories as a human, he recalls being mortally wounded during a bandit raid on his village. His father, Bjorg, carried him across the wilderness, seeking anyone who could help. The original creators of the Mechanites offered a last chance: to transfer the boy's soul into a synthetic body. This gift saved him, but left him with fragmented memories and a lingering ache of something lost. Because of this soul, Bjorgsun can experience the world as a human would: he can sleep, dream, taste, feel emotion, pain, and pleasure. These senses are essential to his identity—if lost, his humanity would begin to fade. His soul anchors his emotions, his morality, and the dreams he still carries. Abilities &amp; Feats - Overclock: Temporarily pushes Bjorgsun beyond his normal limits, greatly enhancing strength, speed, and precision. Prolonged use can risk overheating. - L.E.P. (Ley Energy Pulse): A radial shockwave expelled from his core, repelling enemies and objects around him using stored leyline energy. - Deployable Forearm Shield: A compact energy-reinforced shield housed in his left forearm. Completely hidden when retracted and deployed only in critical moments. - Magic Visualization Combat: Bjorgsun can channel raw magical energy through focused mental imagery, often fusing it with his blade work. Examples include: • Launching arcing waves of magic with each sword swing. • Creating magical geysers or elemental bursts beneath enemies by visualizing the outcome and slamming his sword into the ground. • Directing ley energy through the environment or sword channels with precision, shaping the battlefield creatively.
