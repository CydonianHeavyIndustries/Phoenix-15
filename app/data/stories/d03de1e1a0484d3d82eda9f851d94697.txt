Sovrek - Loyal Companion of Bjorgsun Overview Sovrek is a dire wolf companion, roughly the size of a small horse. Though far less mechanical in appearance than his counterpart Bjorgsun, Sovrek's body hides subtle mechanite enhancements beneath a dense, soft coat of fur. He was created at the same time as Bjorgsun—designed not as a subordinate, but as a lifelong companion and battle partner. He is fiercely loyal, immensely strong, and retains many canine quirks—especially a deep fondness for bacon and scritches behind the ears. Appearance Sovrek resembles a large, powerful wolf with thick, mottled fur and a proud stance. His tail is long and fluffy, often swaying or curling expressively. His most striking feature is his head: while mostly covered in skin and fur, the top of his skull—including the forehead and upper muzzle—is sheathed in reinforced metallic plating, giving him an intimidating, skull-like visage. His ears, however, remain natural and fluffy. His eyes glow faintly orange and gold, betraying his inner connection to mechanite engineering. Mechanite Enhancements Though not visibly robotic, Sovrek possesses several internal augmentations: - A circular dual-heart system increases blood flow and stamina. - Reinforced tendons, ligaments, and muscle sheaths improve his durability and striking power. - Bone plating throughout his limbs and ribcage improves resilience. - Enhanced jaw pressure due to mechanized tendon and muscular integration. - Cybernetic memory linked to scent: bacon elicits instinctual response and minor boosts in agility or drive. Behavior &amp; Personality Sovrek is both a guardian and a friend. While intelligent, he relies on instinct and emotional cues more than speech or planning. He was forged as Bjorgsun’s equal in companionship, not as a pet or servant. The two share a deep, unspoken bond. Sovrek does not speak; instead, he communicates through body language, barks, growls and howls. He is highly perceptive and often conveys complex emotions and warnings nonverbally. Despite his combat readiness, Sovrek enjoys resting beside campfires, being petted, and indulging in the simple pleasures of life—particularly bacon. Weaknesses - Weak spot for ear scritches. - Easily distracted by bacon. - Requires daily sustenance or begins to suffer from energy loss. Roll Modifiers (Narrative Only) In narrative-based roll situations, Sovrek receives advantage or a natural bonus in checks involving: - Strength - Toughness / Constitution - Speed (mobility or reactions) - Detection (smell, hearing, presence) - Discretion (stealth or subtle movement)
