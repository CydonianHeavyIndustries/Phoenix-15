# Bjorgsun-26 — Short-Form EULA / Terms (Draft)

**Jurisdiction:** Canada (Québec preferred).  
**Owner:** You (the author/father). Users must accept before download/install. This draft is not legal advice.

## 1) License + Scope
- Non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use Bjorgsun-26 for personal/authorized business use.
- No resale, relicensing, monetization, or providing the software as a service to others without written permission.
- No reverse engineering, disassembly, or attempts to bypass protections.

## 2) Ownership + Moral Rights
- All IP remains yours. Contributions from others are licensed to you; contributors must grant a broad license and waive/consent to modification of moral rights where applicable.
- Branding, prompts, personalities, voice, lore, and models remain your property.

## 3) Acceptable Use
- Only lawful, ethical use. No harassment, abuse, hate, illicit surveillance, or other prohibited conduct.
- No use for weapons, critical-infrastructure attacks, or other ultra-hazardous activity.
- No export, re-export, or use in violation of applicable sanctions/export laws.

## 4) Hosting + Data
- Users acknowledge their device may act as a host/server for AI modules they configure. They are responsible for security, network exposure, data handling, and legal compliance.
- Users control and remain liable for any data they ingest (lore, memories, logs, recordings, etc.).

## 5) Keys + Access Control
- Users must protect API keys, tokens, and credentials. No sharing or hard-coding secrets into redistributed copies.
- Father/owner keys remain private; rest switch and USBMK tooling are for authorized use only.

## 6) Updates + Safety
- You may push updates, require mandatory model versions, and suspend or disable functionality for safety/legal reasons.
- Safety/monitoring features (alerts, legality filters, owner review) must not be disabled except by you.

## 7) Disclaimers + Liability
- Provided “as is,” without warranties. To the fullest extent permitted by law: no liability for indirect or consequential damages; direct damages capped to amounts paid (if any).
- Users accept all responsibility for outcomes of their deployments and any autonomous actions of the AI.

## 8) Termination
- License terminates on breach. Upon termination, users must uninstall and stop using the software; no further rights to redistribute or access updates.

## 9) Governing Law / Venue
- Québec (or Canada) law governs. Courts in Québec (or your chosen province) have exclusive jurisdiction, except where prohibited by mandatory consumer law.

## 10) Notices / Contact
- Provide your contact channel (email/Discord) for legal notices and support.

## 11) No Public Sale Without Permission
- Unauthorized sale or monetization is strictly prohibited; violation gives you the right to pursue damages (you’ve indicated CAD 90,000,000 as a deterrent—consult counsel to formalize).

## 12) Server Consent
- Users explicitly consent that their device may operate as a server/host for the AI and acknowledge the associated responsibilities and risks.

## Integration Notes (Codebase)
- Pre-download click-through on the website is required (no download without acceptance).
- In-app installer already enforces explicit agreement; father install can bypass for your own machines.
- Alerts, legality filters, and owner review queues must stay enabled unless you (owner) disable them.
